# Music-Genre-Classification
We aim to classify music into progressive rock and non-progressive rock music. In recent years, music recommendation systems have become widely popular with various music streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and YouTube employing this technique as a core element in their applications. The main component of a music recommendation system is music genre classification. A good music genre classifier is a key necessity for building our own music recommendation system. Several studies have been carried out aiming to classify different genres of music, including but not limited to pop, metal, rock, and electronic dance music (EDM). In this study, we focus particularly on progressive rock music, a kind of rock music aiming to distinguish it from all other genres. We use Librosa, an inbuilt Python API for signal processing and feature extraction. For our study, we focus on the spectral, rhythm, and beat features available in Librosa. The baseline classifier performance is judged by using standard supervised and unsupervised learning classifiers. We propose the use of augmented CNN variants which are a mixture of CNN networks for processing the spectral and rhythm images sampled from the music and post-convolution we use meta classifiers to predict the song label. Our results show increased performance in terms of label prediction accuracy in the test set considered
